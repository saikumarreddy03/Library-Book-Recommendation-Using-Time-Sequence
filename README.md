# Library-Book-Recommendation-Using-Time-Sequence
Undergraduate main project

The greatest advantage of the “library book recommendation using time-sequence” is that it combines knowledge learning systems of college students in different majors, providing a new way for universities&#39; book recommender systems.

The code runs on PHP. It must be hosted onto a server to run it and a database of books must be provided for it.
